# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the Top 10 most popular songs and their artists
SELECT  track_name, artist_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

#Then I determined what was the length of the most popular song
SELECT duration_ms, track_name, artist_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 1

#Then I determined which song and artist had the longest song
SELECT duration_ms, track_name, artist_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1
